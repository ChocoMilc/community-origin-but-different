# Community Origin
An origin, made by a community.

## The Idea & Rules
This origin will start out blank. Any person may make a Pull Request to add whatever feature they want, provided they can code it themself.

PRs must be reviewed by _@imaradio_ (aka _@\_radio\__ on Discord) or _@musicalbench28_ (_@musicalbench282_ on Discord).

You cannot edit the "Idea & Rules" section of the README, or the LICENSE file. Anything else is fair game.

Releases will be made every time a Pull Request is accepted.
